# ASCII-Gen
A generator for ASCII-Art.


Im still working on this, but the basic functionality is given.

Syntax: [toolname] [path_to_pic] 

As this script sends its output to stdout, i recommand to pipe it to a textfile or something. E.g. ./asciiart somepic.png > someascii.txt

Im even thinking about a GUI and support for windows... The lack of good (open source & free) generators is sad :(

-> The name asciigen is temporary, i guess i'm a little uncreative today...
